# To-Do 

## Release 0: Setup
We are going to create a CRUD app to create To-Do lists. Start by setting up a new Django project. We will be deploying this project to Heroku so you'll want to install `psycopg2` and set up your project with a Postgresql database. 

## Release 1: Models 
Once you're project is set up, create a new app for To-Do lists and set up your models. 
- A User should be able to create multiple lists. 
- Each list can have many tasks associated with it. 
- Each task belongs to one List. 
- Users should be able to create, read, update, and destroy a List. 
- Users should be able to create, read, update, and destroy Tasks on a List. 
- Each Task should have a boolean value for completion. `task.completed = True` 
- Each Task should have a due date. 

## Release 2: Front End 
Start a new react app to act as the front end for your To-Do List. 
- On the main page, a user should see all of Lists that still have incomplete tasks. 
- Clicking on a list will take you to a List page that displays all the tasks for that list. 
- From here a user should be able to: 
    - create new tasks 
    - update existing tasks
    - mark a task as complete

## Release 3: Additional Functionality 
Once you have the basic CRUD functionality working, add **at least one** of the following features. You'll have to-do your own research to figure out how to impliment some of these. Don't worry, spending hours and hours reading blogs and documentation is a huge part of programming. If you get frustrated, you're doing it right. 

### Easy-ish
- Add a feature for users to view all their completed Lists. 
- Add the ability to add a status to each task. Something like `task.status = 'Awaiting Review'` or `task.status = 'Started'`

### Less Easy
- Add the ability to link a task to another List. Example: Say you had a list called Tasks For the Week, and one of the tasks was "Create a new Crud Challenge for Code Platoon Students" That task might have many steps, so it would link to a new List with a list of tasks for writing the challenge. 
- Right now our tasks are probably displayed in the order they were created. How can you add the ability to order and re-order tasks for a given list?
